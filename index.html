<p> Tobias Jansen, <i>some people call him TBZ</i>, is a musician, sound engineer, and dj based in <s>Köln</s> Berlin, Germany. </p>

<p> Published solo work dates back to 2010 and has more recently been released on chart-topping record labels like <a href="https://brewrecords.bandcamp.com/album/bx" target="_blank">Brew</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y9C8W0cVRJA?feature=shared" target="_blank">R=A</a>, <a href="https://taxfreerecords.bandcamp.com/track/side-e" target="_blank">Tax Free</a>, <a href="https://stenzequo.bandcamp.com/album/tbz-tbz" target="_blank">Stenze Quo</a> and his <a href="https://tttbbbzzz.bandcamp.com/album/new" target="_blank">private imprint</a>.</p>

<p> As a collaborator, he has taken on various roles, serving as the guiding force behind (con)fusion music ensemble <a href="https://montelpalmer.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Montel Palmer</a> and previously as a scratch-sidekick in <a href="https://devonrexiband.bandcamp.com/album/biya-ba-man" target="_blank">Devon Rexi</a>.
    Other projects include exploring <i>high-voltage machine grime</i> with Robert Bergman as <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/11493712--Coozie-Mad-Sick-" target="_blank">&#9832;</a>, skeleton-dub science as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aibOdUir_Jo" target="_blank">GRRRR</a> with Max Graef, and the hip hop duo <a href="https://larat.bandcamp.com/album/la-rat" target="_blank">La Rat</a> with Goya van der Heijden. Together with James Pants, he developed an open-source polyrhythmic drum machine named <a href="https://e-drums.biz" target="_blank">E-Drums</a>.</p>

<p> Live performances have taken place across Europe, with appearances at venues and festivals such as Meakusma, Moers Festival, Braille Satellite, Aktionshaus, Open Ground, OCCII, Salon Des Amateurs, and many more - regulary sharing stage with performers like Wilted Woman, Yosa Peit, Nicolini, Sebastian von der Heide, and Malcolm Mooney. <i>Expect an amalgam of styles and tempi imbued with an outsider B-Boy mentality.</i></p>

<p> He has broadcasted on radio stations including <a href="https://dublab.de/shows/planet-rescue/" target="_blank">Dublab</a>, <a href="https://www.nts.live/shows/creepzone/episodes/creep-zone-w-james-pants-marc-schaller-26th-march-2018" target="_blank">NTS</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dkmntl/dekmantel-radio-w-radical-hi-fi-jah-beers-02112018" target="_blank">Red Light</a>, and <a href="https://noodsradio.com/residents/montel-palmer" target="_blank">Noods</a>. Between 2009 and 2019, he hosted various dj residencies in Köln, predominantly at now-extinct Stecken and Acephale.</p>

<p> Under the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/9298279-The-Cologne-Wizard" target="_blank">cgnwizard</a> moniker, he has mixed, mastered, and supervised numerous records for labels such as Planet Rescue, South Of North, Tax Free, Termina, and Acetone. Professionally he also served as a core team member and radio engineer of <a href="https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/" target="_blank">RBMA</a>'s flagship events in Toyko, Paris, Montreal, New York, and Berlin.</p>

<p> Moreover, he enjoys hard-boiled eggs and is enthusiastic about computer science, reed instruments and cheap (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/acetone-records/dj2beers" target="_blank">Jamaican</a>) vinyl.</p>
